In order to export the fonts correctly, and not cause any regressions, we had to set up a new build process. This process must generate a regular master and a black master (in both Upright and Italic) from instances. If you want to contribute, you can delete them, and keep only the 6pt and 96pt masters.
The font onboarder will generate them again for export.
